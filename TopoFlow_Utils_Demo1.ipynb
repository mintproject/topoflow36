    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use a collection of TopoFlow utilities to create required input files for the TopoFlow hydrologic model.  Before you can run the code in this notebook, you will need to install the TopoFlow 3.6 Python package. This notebook uses numerous utilities from the TopoFlow 3.6 package, in <b>topoflow/utils</b>.  Detailed instructions and background information for how to install TopoFlow in a conda environment are given in Appendix 1: Installing TopoFlow in a conda Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the important issue of <b>portability</b>.  By simply specifying a geographic bounding box and a few other bits of information for <b>any river basin in Ethiopia</b> in the first few cells, you can create all of the input files that are required by TopoFlow (except space-time meteorological grids, like rainfall rates, as discussed near the end.)  With a few other very minor changes, this notebook could create input files required by TopoFlow for <b>any river basin on Earth</b>.  This is because it uses data sets that are available <b>globally</b>, such as the\n",

    "Note that <b>conda</b> is the name of the package manager for the popular Anaconda Python distribution.  One feature of conda is support for multiple environments, which are isolated from one another.  When you install Anaconda, an environment called <b>base</b> is created for you and a base set of commonly-used Python packages are installed there.  However, you can (and should!) create additional, named environments and install different sets of Python packages into them without worrying about potential conflicts with packages in other environments.  Type <b>conda env list</b> to list your available environments.  You can switch to one of your other environments using the command <b>conda activate envname</b>.  (Replace \"envname\" with the name of an environment.) You can switch back to the base environment with the command <b>conda deactivate</b>.  It is better not to install new packages into the base environment.  See the online conda documentation on [<b>Managing Environments</b>](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to update conda itself before creating new environments and installing packages in them. The \"-n\" flag is followed by the name of the environment to update, and the \"-c\" flag is followed by the name of the <b>channel</b> from which to get packages.  A channel is a collection of Python packages that are provided and maintained by some group.  The word \"defaults\" refers to\n",

    "refers to another popular collection and the GitHub organization that maintains it.  Many Python packages are available from both of these channels.  (However, the ipyleaflet and pydap  packages are currently not available in the Anaconda collection.) When you are installing several packages into an environment, the potential for installation problems seems to be less if you get them all from the same channel.  Keep in mind that packages you install will likely depend on many other Python packages, so there is a potential for conflicts, usually related to different package versions.  Using conda environments helps to mitigate against this and helps with <b>reproducibility</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've switched to an environment with <b>conda activate envname</b>, you can type <b>conda list</b> to see a list of packages.

The kernel name is displayed in the upper right corner.  Notebooks typically open with the \"environment kernel\" they were created with.

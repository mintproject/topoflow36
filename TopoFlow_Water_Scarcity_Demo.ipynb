    "This notebook shows how to model water scarcity with the TopoFlow hydrologic model.  The main variables that characterize water scarcity are (1) river discharge, (2) the soil moisture profile with depth, and (3) the depth to the groundwater table.  Simulations of water movement through the subsurface (i.e. through soil) are computationally intensive and take much longer than other model runs."

One feature of conda is support for multiple environments, which are isolated from one another.  When you install Anaconda, an environment called <b>base</b> is created for you and a base set of commonly-used Python packages are installed there.  However, you can (and should!) create additional, named environments and install different sets of Python packages into them without worrying about potential conflicts with packages in other environments.  Type <b>conda env list</b> to list your available environments.  You can switch to one of your other environments using the command <b>conda activate envname</b>.  (Replace \"envname\" with the name of an environment.) You can switch back to the base environment with the command <b>conda deactivate</b>.  It is better not to install new packages into the base environment.  See the online conda documentation on [<b>Managing Environments</b>](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always a good idea to update conda itself before creating new environments and installing packages in them. The \"-n\" flag is followed by the name of the environment to update, and the \"-c\" flag is followed by the name of the <b>channel</b> from which to get packages.  A channel is a collection of Python packages that are provided and maintained by some group.  The word \"defaults\" refers to\n",

When you are installing several packages into an environment, the potential for installation problems seems to be less if you get them all from the same channel.  Keep in mind that packages you install will likely depend on many other Python packages, so there is a potential for conflicts, usually related to different package versions.  Using conda environments helps to mitigate against this and helps with <b>reproducibility</b>.\n",

    "Once you've switched to an environment with <b>conda activate envname</b>, you can type <b>conda list</b> to see a list of packages.
